# HomieNodeCollection

HomieNodeCollection is my collection of useful Nodes. Currently it supports:

Ready:
  * LED-Strip (RGB+White) support (PWM including gamma correction)
  * Sensors HTU21D and BMP280
  * PCF8575 16Bit I/O extension

Work in progress:
  * WS2812 LED strip support
  
It also included a logging facility, but recently I moved this to a own library [HomieLoggerNode](https://github.com/euphi/HomieLoggerNode).
