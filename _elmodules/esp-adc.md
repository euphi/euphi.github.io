# ESP-ADC

The ESP-ADC module is a breadboard-friendly breakout-board of the ESP8266 chip and exposes all possible GPIOs.
Unfortunately, it has only 512kB flash, so it is not possible to perform OTA (over-the-air) updates with it.

As all ESP8266 modules it is very sensitive to overvoltage, so be careful while handling it.
