I created a simple [library](https://github.com/euphi/ESP_Homie_WS2812FX) to connect the nice [WS2812FX](https://github.com/kitesurfer1404/WS2812FX) library to Homie.

It was a pleasure to see how quick and easy it is to adapt a library to [Homie-ESP8266](https://github.com/marvinroger/homie-esp8266) :-)

Coding was less than 3 hours - including some improvements to  my [HomieNodeCollection](https://github.com/euphi/HomieNodeCollection) (moving the logging mechanism to a new separate lib named [HomieLoggerNode](https://github.com/euphi/HomieLoggerNode).).

I also created a sample integration for openHAB - this is also described on the project page on github:
